#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a text summarization tool using the Google Pegasus model. The tool will ingest conversational datasets, validate and transform the data, train the model, and generate summaries. This project will be beneficial for applications requiring concise representations of lengthy text conversations, such as customer support logs, meeting transcripts, or any text-heavy communication channels.

##*Use Case*
Scenario: A customer support team wants to summarize lengthy customer interaction logs to quickly understand the key points and issues raised by customers. By summarizing these logs, support agents can more efficiently address recurring issues and improve customer satisfaction.

###*Stage 1: Data Ingestion*
Purpose: To collect and load the conversational datasets into the system.
Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
datasets: A library by Hugging Face for accessing and handling datasets.

###*Stage 2: Data Validation*
Purpose: To ensure the quality and consistency of the data before feeding it into the model.
Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and validation.
numpy: For numerical operations and handling missing values.

###*Stage 3: Data Transformation*
Purpose: To prepare the data in a format suitable for model training.
Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation.
nltk or spacy: For text preprocessing such as tokenization, removing stopwords, etc.

###*Stage 4: Model Training*
Purpose: To train the Google Pegasus model on the prepared dataset for text summarization.
Libraries Used:
transformers: Hugging Face library for model training and handling.
torch: PyTorch library for tensor operations and model training.

###*Stage 5: Text Summarization*
Purpose: To use the trained model to generate summaries for new conversational text inputs.
Libraries Used:
transformers: For using the trained model to generate summaries.
